V4.4 (2021-02-08)
  - Migrated from picasm to GPUtils. The code itself is unchanged.

V4.3 (2000-11-02)
  - Bugfix: some Logitech cordless mice send an unstable bit
    8, which caused YAMI to resynchronize too often.

V4.2 (1999-11-29)
  - Bugfix: fixed the "shiver on LMB" bug. It was caused by
    timing problems with the PIC's prefetch queue

V4.1 (1999-09-05)
  - Bugfix: wheel moves were not sign extended

V4.0 (1999-09-04)
  - Added hardware mouse wheel support via the Joystick port
  - Overall major code optimizations

V3.6 (1999-08-30)
  - Improved timing, so the mouse will move smoother

V3.5 (1999-06-24)
  - Implemented Atari mode: HQ and V is swapped. MMB is disabled.
  - Atari mode is selected by pulling pin 3 low (V3 only!).

V3.4 (1998-02-25)
  - Wheel speed read from EEPROM table now

V3.3 (1998-02-25)
  - Bugfix: forgot to turn off weak pullup of port B
  - Bugfix: slow mouse movements were unaccurate
  - Improved Wheel button behaviour for Voyager
  - Joystick test implemented
  - Short delay at program start, to skip identification packet
  - Logarithmic wheel movement
  - First public release

V3.2 (1998-02-21)
  - Outputs are now driven as Low/Tristate, to protect the
    hardware against short circuit

V3.1 (1998-02-20)
  - MouseMan/Intellimouse supported

V3.0 (1998-02-18)
  - Made the code run on a PIC-16C84 with only 4MHz clock

V2.3 (1998-02-08)
  - Large mouse moves let the mouse pointer move in waves. This
    effect has been removed, by generating quadrature pulses
    using sort of a Bresenham algorithm.
  - Made the source code more MPASM compliant

V2.2 (1998-02-03)
  - Improved mouse format recognition
  - Replaced all code from the proof of concept

V2.1 (1998-01-30)
  - Some more optimizations

V2.0 (1998-01-26)
  - Rewrote most parts of source code
  - Implemented Logitech format extension
  - Improved 7 bit handling, auto-resynchronisation
  - Some cleanups and optimizations

V1.0 (1998-01-03)
  - First version, proof of concept
